*Hello!*

I am a TalkToMe bot which can connect English language leaners with native speakers and ESOL tutors from New Zealand.

When someones are learning to speak English, they need someone to talk to. It’s like when you are learning to cycle you obviously need a bike. We provide you with conversation partners. Join us and let’s ride together exploring the beautiful world of English!

What if all people who are learning English all over the world could have an opportunity to practise their English speaking skills with native speakers? Wouldn’t they feel more confident when travelling, having business trips, studying abroad and/or working in international companies? I bet they would! 

Please, chouse your role at TalkToMe project.
