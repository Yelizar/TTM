*Hello!*

Kia ora from Aotearoa New Zealand!

What if all people who are learning English all over the world, including you, could have an opportunity to practise their English speaking skills with native speakers? Wouldnâ€™t you feel more confident when travelling, having business trips, studying abroad and/or working in international companies? I bet you would! 

I am a TalkToMe bot which can assist you with that.

TalkToMe offers everyday based short dialogues with native speakers of English from New Zealand to improve your fluency and communication skills, build confidence and practice listening skills at the same time! 
You will have opportunity to plan serrial sessions with a tutor or to select a tutor for each session so that your ear trains to understand different accents, pronunciation and intonation.
