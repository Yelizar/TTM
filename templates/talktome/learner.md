*Kia ora from Aotearoa New Zealand!*

TalkToMe offers short dialogues with native speakers of English from New Zealand to improve your fluency and communication skills, build confidence and practice listening skills at the same time! 

You will have opportunity to plan serrial sessions with a tutor or to select a tutor for each session so that your ear trains to understand different accents, pronunciation and intonation.

I am a TalkToMe bot, I will assist you with that.
